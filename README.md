# Update 26/07/2022
Changed this repo to ONLY contain my personal steps in game hacking. 

So you will be able to follow my exact steps (skipping the useless ones).

# Golden rule

Don't skip any content! With content I mean: lessons, videos, testings, asking your doubts, etc... DON'T SKIP ANYTHING EVEN IF IT LOOKS EZ.

Read everything and check everything in your scenarios (try to use Assault Cube or an easy game). This is the most important thing.

If there's something you're experienced on, then it's an opportunity to test new methods. 

You still have things to test, else you won't be reading this.


# Month 1

- It's your first month and you will be lost easily in almost everything you do. Don't worry, that is because you're learning.
- You task here is to understand the basics. You have to be honest with yourself... if you don't understand something 100% repeat and ask in forums.
- Don't have an exact goal now other than learning and understanding perfectly from A to Z. If you're not able to explain what you've learned to someone without reading your notes, then it's because that lesson it's still not learned.
- Don't try to hack your favorite game from first moment. You probably will get frustrated.
- You will spend the entire month learning this techniques: finding values in Cheat Engine, Read & write memory, pointers, multilevel pointers, assembly basic instructions, understanding what is a basic data structure like LocalPlayer class, make your first External or Internal trainer that reads/writes simple values to memory
- Yes, you don't need to spend 1 month with values and pointers as other guides might suggest. That's totally wrong, we need to move forward.

# Month 2

- Now you have an idea of the basics. Now you have a sharp tool but you don't really know in which scenarios could be useful.
- You should understand finding values, read/write and pointers perfectly at this point. If you don't, go back to first month because you've skipped lessons.
- This month we will focus in understanding programs flow. So in a future, we will be able to hook and call game functions by our own.
- Spend this month with: AOB injection, calling conventions, calling functions

# Month 3

- It's time to learn hooking :)
- We also learned what are data structures and how to read values, probably you want to learn how to read a complete structure at once

# Months 4 & 5

- Patching instructions and restoring stolen bytes (this one could be before or after DX/GL hooking)
- This month will be dedicated to learning Direct3D and OpenGL hooking.
- After hooking, you probably want to learn about ImGui to create your cool menus.

# Month 6 and forward

- Keep reading forums like unknowncheats & guidedhacking and show your works, they will help you improving
- Watch youtube videos about reversing and coding
- Try to make as many testings as possible! 90% of my knowledge comes from trial and error

# Important notes: 

- If you think one month is too much time for the specified lessons that's because you didn't spend enough time testing.
- The most common mistake when learning hacking is assuming you already know X. Remember golden rule: never skip lessons.

I think I didn't forget anything... I will try to keep updating this list with my actual knowledge.

Remember this list only reflects my path in learning game hacking so I know there are more advanced things that I didn't cover
