# Update 26/07/2022
I will change this repo to ONLY contain my personal steps in game hacking. So you will be able to follow my exact steps (skipping the useless ones).

# Golden rule
- Don't skip any content. Read everything and check everything in your scenarios (try to use Assault Cube or an easy game). This is the most important thing.

# First month 

- It's your first month and you will be lost easily in almost everything you do. Don't worry, that is because you're learning.
- You task here is to understand the basics. You have to be honest with yourself... if you don't understand something 100% repeat and ask in forums.
- Don't have an exact goal now other than learning and understanding perfectly from A to Z. If you're not able to explain what you've learned to someone without reading your notes, then it's because that lesson it's still not learned.
- Don't try to hack your favorite game from first moment. You probably will get frustrated.
- You will spend the entire month learning this techniques: finding values in Cheat Engine, Read & write memory, pointers, multilevel pointers, assembly basic instructions, make your first External or Internal trainer that reads/writes simple values to memory
- Yes, you don't need to spend 1 month with values and pointers as other guides might suggest. That's totally wrong, we need to move forward.

# Second month

- Now you have an idea of the basics. Now you have a sharp tool but you don't really know in which scenarios could be useful.
- You should understand finding values, read/write and pointers perfectly at this point. If you don't, go back to first month because you've skipped lessons.
- This month we will focus in understanding programs flow. So in a future, we will be able to hook and call game functions by our own.
